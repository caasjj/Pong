A very simple pong game to demonstrate basic use of the canvas, simple 
(ok, trivial) collision detection, use of timers as event driver, etc.

The objective is to sink the ball in the opening at the opposite wall.

Use <spacebar> to start the game.  The ball will start in a random 
direction at a velocity randomized around a reasonable mean.

Use left/right arrow key to move the red paddle, and up/down keys to 
speed up / slow down the paddle movement.
