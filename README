A very simple pong game to demonstrate basic use of the canvas, simple (trivial?!) collision detection, use of timers as event driver, etc.

Use <spacebar> to start the game.  The ball will start in a random direction at a velocity randomized around a reasonable mean.

Use left/right arrow key to move the red paddle, and up/down key to speed up / slow down the paddle movement.

Objective is to sink the ball in the opening at the opposite wall.
